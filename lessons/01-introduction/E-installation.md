### Basic setup
Lets setup a project to get ready to program in rust and typescript!

#### Directory
first lets create a directory to get everything setup in!

```bash
mkdir ~/personal/rust-typescript
cd ~/personal/rust-typescript
```

### TypeScript setup
This should be easy enough.  we will just use ts-node (feel free to use swc or
whatever you want)

```bash
npm init -y
npm install ts-node typescript @node/types
```

#### Installing rust
For Mac/Linux/Linux like (wsl2)
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Initializing Rust
```bash
cargo init
```

### For my VSCoders

This is probably the right article (i don't use vscode, no idea)
[Disable Inlay Hints, VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67)

real talk, inlay hints in neovim are incredible, inlay hints in vscode are
crazy.  It makes programming really difficult, i would highly suggest turning
them off
