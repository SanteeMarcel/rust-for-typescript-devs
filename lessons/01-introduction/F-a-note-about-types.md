### One more thing about rust
You will here me say the following words

* value
* mutable reference or mutable borrow
* immutable reference or immutable borrow

This isn't something that as a JS dev you think about.

So what is a reference (probably heard the term)?
What is a mutable reference? (probably never heard this)?
(whiteboard)

### () is a unit
`()` is called "unit."  Effectively it is "nothing" value.

```rust
if true {
    println!("foo");
}


// I could write this
// --v this has type ()
let foo = if true {
    println!("foo");
}
```
