### One more thing about rust
You will here me say the following words

* value
* mutable reference or mutable borrow
* immutable reference or immutable borrow

This isn't something that as a JS dev you think about.

So what is a reference (probably heard the term)?
What is a mutable reference? (probably never heard this)?
