### Hopefully you "understand" rust now
The selling point of rust should become more clear now.  Why people _love_ it.
`Option`, `Result`, and `Iterator`s are a foundation of the items you work with
and allow for highly optimized code with great readability

<br />

But there is one more concept that we need to go over.  The Borrow Checker.
This is the item that everyone always talks about when it comes to Rust and
difficulty.  I would argue its not that difficult.  What you just got done
learning is more difficult.

<br />

<br />
<br />

### But first
These next parts are teaching you some of the rust fundamentals that just don't
have a typescript side by side.  To be able to use rust effectively, we need to
cover these

### Stack vs Heap?
You have probably heard this term throughout your career.  It may confuse you
what they are.  To understand rust, it is required you have a very simple
understanding of the stack

(prepare the code)
(whiteboard time!)
(don't forget to mention returing my_foo)
(don't forget to mention Option)
(for every heap allocation, there is a stack allocation)

### Questions?
Do you have questions about this?

### We are going to build a Graph!
We are going to build a graph.  Now how we build this is not considered
"idiomatic" but it really helps in learning:

* borrow checker
* box, rc, heap items
* interior mutability
* traits

Again, how we build this isn't how you would build a graph in rust

### Oh you are not familiar with a graph?
Well lets talk about the basics of graphs

If you want to learn more about algorithms, i have a free course on FEM! Its
free forever, no CC required, just a valid email.
