### To throw or not to throw, that is the question
One of the largest differences between rust and typescript exist with errors.

Ask yourself the following questions
* what function throws an error?
* who handles the error if thrown?
* what type of errors can be thrown?

with javascript you learn by trial. <br/>
with rust, its in the function signature.

### Lets do a small exercise
One of the key things to understand about rust first is errors.  This will help
you navigate a huge amount of rust code early on.

So lets do a small project.  Lets read a file, parse each line as a number,
return the result as number list, and print out the list.
